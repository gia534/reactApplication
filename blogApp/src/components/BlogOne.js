                    <p className={"para"}>In 2020, when the lockdown began (still crazy to note a period of time as
                        "the lockdown"), I had waaay too much time to think. I began to think of my life...what I was
                        doing to make myself successful. Was I aiming for my goal? Have I completed anything on my
                        'Before I Die' list? Back then...the answer to any of those questions were no. Although I can
                        say I completed a few items on my list, there is this one item that will never leave my mind.
                        Gaining enough confidence to live my life comfortably.</p>

                    <p className={"para"}>The point of this blog is to help with that. I want this blog to help me feel
                        comfortable in my own skin. People who know me, who have met me, know that I am a large
                        person...aka fat. I am considered plus size, averaging a jean size of 24 (22 if I am lucky). I
                        want to educate those who don't know what it is like to be a plus-sized person; how social
                        media and tv shows and movies can effect someone like me; encourage others my size to feel
                        more comfortable in their own skin.</p>

                    <p className={"para"}>For those curious, plus size is someone who is NOT considered the standard
                        size of today's society. Meaning size 0 to size 12 (and 12 is even stretching it). Ironically
                        though, besides society thinking anyone below a size 12 is the perfect size, the average women's
                        dress size is between 14 and 16. This means that the average size is plus size. And yet, it is
                        harder for women who wear a size 14 or larger to find clothes they love, or clothes that don't
                        seem too big for them, or clothes that are even remotely cute. Finding a store that sells plus
                        sized clothing for both male and female is tough (worst for men, but that is another story).
                        Being a women finding a decent shirt is like finding a needle in a haystack. Its all blouses and
                        shirts with flowers. And don't even get me started with those damn jeans that somehow are all
                        jeggings with the smallest pockets.</p>
