                    <p className={"para"}>I have always hated shopping. Since I was a kid, I was never a big fan of it.
                        But I hate it even more as a plus sized adult. You know what is worse than going to the mall
                        with your mother as a kid? Going to to the mall as a fat person and having to find that one
                        store that carries clothes above a size 12. Shopping is one of the hardest things to do as
                        someone who is overweight. It does not matter if it is online or in person, it 100 percent sucks.</p>

                    <p className={"para"}>For one, sizes aren't the same in every store. You may be a size 28 in one
                        store, but a 30  in a different store and that store only has one item in the entire store that
                        is a size 30 (and only because someone returned it and the item is now on the clearance rack).
                        Secondly, going to places like Macy's and Nordstrom have the smallest section for plus size
                        clothing. We are forgotten in the fashion industry. The plus-size section is in the back of the
                        store by the bathrooms, maybe, with like 5 racks of clothing. And for some reason all of the
                        clothes look like they are from the 1960's. </p>

                    <p className={"para"}>As for the stores that do carry plus size clothes, Torrid and Lane Bryant to
                        name the few of the few, for some reason all of their clothes have flowers on them. Like every
                        plus sized lady wants flowers on their shirts! They also have a whole bunch of swing shirts,
                        which are shirts that are long and kind of look like they're swinging in the wind. Again...not
                        every women wants t-shirts that swing in the wind. We want to wear clothes that are trending
                        now, but for some reason all we get are flowers. </p>
